# hourlydbr

The goal of hourlydbr is to provide tools to create, populate, maintain
and query a database of hourly data.

It is built to be simple with as few dependencies as possible. And also
something to which additional functionality can be added without
requiring alteration of underlying database.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("poissonconsulting/hourlydbr")
```
